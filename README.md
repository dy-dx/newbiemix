A TF2 matchmaking system created for the weekend [6v6 Newbie Mix](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/na6v6newbiemix) events.
Runs on node.js, express, mongodb and redis.


**I made this when I was first learning node.js, so there are probably some questionable decisions in the code. It may still be of use to someone who wants to make a browser-based matchmaking system.**
